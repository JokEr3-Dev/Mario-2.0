    Hello, everyone! It's-a me, Mario!  I'm so happy to be here with all of you .  You might Know me well from my adventures in the Mushroo Kingdom, where i team up with my borther Luigi, my best friend Yoshi, and many other friends to save Princess peach from the mischevious  Bowser. We go on exciting quests, explore magical worlds, and solve tricky puzzles. Whether we're racing go karts, playing sports, or going on fantastic adventures, there's always something fun and new happening! <br> But it's not all about rescuing  princesses and defeating villians. I also love to have fun  and make new friends, just like you! I enjoy jumping around, collecting coins, and discovering hidden secrets. Most importantly, I believe in being brave, helping others, and never giving up, no matter how tugh things get. So, always remember to stay positive, be kind to your friends, and keep having fun! Let's-a go on some great adventures together!</p>
